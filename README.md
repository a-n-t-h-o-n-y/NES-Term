## Build

Relies on cmake to generate build files for the `nes-term` target. git
submodules are used; run `git submodule update --init` after cloning.

## Run

The emulator can run a game by specifying the ROM file as the first argument
when launching from the terminal.

Root privileges are required for proper keyboard input in the terminal, key
release events cannot be accessed without opening the console as a file, which
requires root.

From the build directory:

`sudo ./src/nes-term ~/location/of/ROM/file`

The release build seems to run fine at 60fps; debug will be slow üêå

The NES has a resolution of 256x240, if your terminal is not expanded to at
least this size, the display will be scaled to a lower resolution. It is
recommended to make the font size much smaller in order to get the full
resolution(ctrl + (plus/minus) changes font size on most terminals).

Lower resolution scalling.

Sound is not implemented.

## Controls

Only Player 1 is implemented. Open an issue if you can think of a good keyboard
layout for two players.

- D-Pad:    __Arrows keys__
- A Button: __z__
- B Button: __x__
- Start:    __Enter__
- Select:   __Backspace__
